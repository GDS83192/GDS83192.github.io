I am a beginner developer who first became interested in the tech industry by seeking employment. While researching occupational outlooks, I learned that web developers are in demand. I learned about boot camp programs and found Flatiron School on course report. From here I took the boot camp prep course on Learn.co, and Iâ€™ve been hooked on advancing my tech skills ever since. I believe my interest in technology and aptitude for problem solving could lead to a productive and satisfying career as a web developer. 

A stable career is a glimmering prospect for many in an unstable job market. For me, web development is more than just a job. Learning to code and engage with the internet has provided insight into how we might solve global problems through improved communication and understanding. The web allows us to work together in ways we never could before, and I believe developers play an important role in maximizing the ability of the internet to connect people and solve problems. I feel that through learning about tech, I increase my chances of being part of the change I want to see in the world. I am grateful to be in a position that afforded me the time and resources to begin entering the tech world. I now wish to use the experience I have gained in the past two months to really get moving.   	"
